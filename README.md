# Parallel Hyperparameter Tuning

This repository provides a complete, automated workflow for GPU-accelerated hyperparameter tuning of a ResNet model using GitHub Actions powered by Machine.dev. It systematically explores combinations of key training parameters—such as learning rates and batch sizes—to identify the optimal configuration for training a ResNet model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

### ✨ **Key Features**

- **⚡ GPU Acceleration:** Efficiently train and evaluate models using GPUs via [Machine](https://machine.dev)
- **🧪 Systematic Tuning:** Automate the exploration of multiple hyperparameter combinations
- **📊 Performance Comparison:** Automatically aggregate and compare model metrics
- **📤 Artifact Storage:** Conveniently store and retrieve metrics and comparison results using GitHub Actions artifacts
- **📈 Easy Interpretation:** Identify the best-performing configuration quickly with structured CSV outputs

### ▶️ **Getting Started**

#### 1. **Use This Repository as a Template**
Click the **Use this template** button at the top of this page to create your own copy.

#### 2. **Set Up GPU Runners**
Ensure your repository uses Machine GPU-powered runners. No additional configuration is required if you're already using Machine.dev.

#### 3. **Run the Workflow**

- Trigger the workflow manually in GitHub Actions (`workflow_dispatch`)
- The workflow automatically runs training jobs for each combination of hyperparameters defined in the matrix:

  ```yaml
  matrix:
    learning_rate: [0.001, 0.0005]
    batch_size: [32, 64]
  ```

#### 4. **Monitor and Review Results**

- Training progress and metrics are logged during each workflow execution
- Performance metrics for each hyperparameter set are saved as artifacts (`metrics-{learning_rate}-{batch_size}`)
- A final comparison of all training results is saved as `model_comparison.csv` in the artifact `comparison-results`
